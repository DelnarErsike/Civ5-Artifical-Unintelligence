Civ5-Artificial-Unintelligence-DLL
=============================

Civilization V AI Mod's DLL Source Code

All changes I made from the unmodified Civ5 code are wrapped in preprocessor directives.
A catalog of all preprocessor directives is located in AuI.h.

Note that I have not (yet) modified non-Brave New World code.
